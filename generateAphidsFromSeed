%REMEMBER: if you're calling this for the purposes of generating data and
%don't want pictures, then be sure to comment out the plot and pause lines
%in modelAphid! (there are two plot commands, one in the loop and one above.)

%since this is designed to work with code built for the original aphid
%data, there's a bizarre ordering: the columns go

%video number | aphid number | frame number | x coord | y coord

%clc

numFrames = 1; %number of frames you want in each experiment

aphidData = [];
firstFrames = load('firstFrames.csv');

for k = 1:9 %there are only nine experiments. there have only ever been nine experiments. 'there are seven experiments,' they tell you. why do you have so much data?
    indx = (firstFrames(:,1) == k);
    init = firstFrames(indx, [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]); %aphid number, xcoord, ycoord, xdir, ydir, moving
    vec = k*ones(numFrames*N, 1);
    nextVideo = [vec, modelAphidSeed(numFrames, init)];
    aphidData = [aphidData; nextVideo];
end

csvwrite('nonsenseData.csv', aphidData)
