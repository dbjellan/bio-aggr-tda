% This’ll call either modelAphidSeed or modelAphidNoInteraction, whichever 
% isn’t commented out. As you might expect, the first uses the interactive 
% model and the latter the control model. Outer for loop (index k) goes 
% through whatever experiments you want, usually gonna be 1-9. Inner for 
% loop (index m) runs through all the runs you wanna do. Check to make sure 
% that both of these have the correct ranges and that you are WRITING TO THE 
% CORRECT FILE NAME. Do NOT write to fullModelData when you mean to write to 
% fullNoInteractionData.

%REMEMBER: if you're calling this for the purposes of generating data and
%don't want pictures, then be sure to comment out the plot and pause lines
%in modelAphid! (there are two plot commands, one in the loop and one above.)

%since this is designed to work with code built for the original aphid
%data, there's a bizarre ordering: the columns go

%video number | aphid number | frame number | x coord | y coord

%clc

frames = [4605; 5647; 5651; 5409; 5409; 5221; 5332; 5418; 5883];
